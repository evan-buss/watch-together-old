 ☐ Create a login page where users enter their username and either create or join a room
 ☐ Add Hub methods that allow viewing data without modifying it (maintain thread safety)

Maybes:
    ☐ Websockets should belong to channels
        - If I make this more of a centralized application, users should only receive messages from their channel
        - Sort of a pub/sub style...


Probably going to restructure the layout. Not sure what my plans are tbh
    better ways to split api
    better naming for the imdb scraping library


Project Layout
    - `cmd` - Contains all binary commands and starts the application
    - `doc` - Contains all documentation to understand the project and document important development things I've learned along the way
    - `info` - Contains code to extract data from a given media file (makes use of ffprobe)
    - `server` - Contains code that serves the API and backend
    - `video` - Contains all media related code. Anything to turn a media file into an HLS playlist that is then served via the API
    - `web` - Contains all frontend code written in svelte.
