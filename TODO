☐ Adapt websocket server to deal with no only chat messages.
☐ Create a login page where users enter their username and either create or join a room
☐ Add Hub methods that allow viewing data without modifying it (maintain thread safety)

Maybes:
  ☐ Websockets should belong to channels
    - If I make this more of a centralized application, users should only receive messages from their channel
